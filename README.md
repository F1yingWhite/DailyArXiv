| **[What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07402v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the seven multimodal benchmarks.

| **[DoraCycle: Domain-Oriented Adaptation of Unified Generative Model in Multimodal Cycles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03651v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting generative models to specific domains presents an effective solution for satisfying specialized requirements. However, adapting to some complex domains remains challenging, especially when these domains require substantial paired data to capture the targeted distributions. Since unpaired data from a single modality, such as vision or language, is more readily available, we utilize the bidirectional mappings between vision and language learned by the unified generative model to enable training on unpaired data for domain adaptation. Specifically, we propose DoraCycle, which integrates two multimodal cycles: text-to-image-to-text and image-to-text-to-image. The model is optimized through cross-entropy loss computed at the cycle endpoints, where both endpoints share the same modality. This facilitates self-evolution of the model without reliance on annotated text-image pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that for tasks independent of paired knowledge, such as stylization, DoraCycle can effectively adapt the unified model using only unpaired data. For tasks involving new paired knowledge, such as specific identities, a combination of a small set of paired image-text examples and larger-scale unpaired data is sufficient for effective domain-oriented adaptation. The code will be released at https://github.com/showlab/DoraCycle.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[DongbaMIE: A Multimodal Information Extraction Dataset for Evaluating Semantic Understanding of Dongba Pictograms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03644v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dongba pictographs are the only pictographs still in use in the world. They have pictorial ideographic features, and their symbols carry rich cultural and contextual information. Due to the lack of relevant datasets, existing research has difficulty in advancing the study of semantic understanding of Dongba pictographs. To this end, we propose DongbaMIE, the first multimodal dataset for semantic understanding and extraction of Dongba pictographs. The dataset consists of Dongba pictograph images and their corresponding Chinese semantic annotations. It contains 23,530 sentence-level and 2,539 paragraph-level images, covering four semantic dimensions: objects, actions, relations, and attributes. We systematically evaluate the GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0, and Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results show that the F1 scores of GPT-4o and Gemini in the best object extraction are only 3.16 and 3.11 respectively. The F1 score of Qwen2-VL after supervised fine-tuning is only 11.49. These results suggest that current large multimodal models still face significant challenges in accurately recognizing the diverse semantic information in Dongba pictographs. The dataset can be obtained from this URL.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMBind: Unleashing the Potential of Distributed and Heterogeneous Data for Multimodal Learning in IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12126v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal sensing systems are increasingly prevalent in various real-world applications. Most existing multimodal learning approaches heavily rely on training with a large amount of synchronized, complete multimodal data. However, such a setting is impractical in real-world IoT sensing applications where data is typically collected by distributed nodes with heterogeneous data modalities, and is also rarely labeled. In this paper, we propose MMBind, a new data binding approach for multimodal learning on distributed and heterogeneous IoT data. The key idea of MMBind is to construct a pseudo-paired multimodal dataset for model training by binding data from disparate sources and incomplete modalities through a sufficiently descriptive shared modality. We also propose a weighted contrastive learning approach to handle domain shifts among disparate data, coupled with an adaptive multimodal learning architecture capable of training models with heterogeneous modality combinations. Evaluations on ten real-world multimodal datasets highlight that MMBind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under varying degrees of data incompleteness and domain shift, and holds promise for advancing multimodal foundation model training in IoT applications\footnote (The source code is available via https://github.com/nesl/multimodal-bind).</p></details> |  |
| **[More than Memes: A Multimodal Topic Modeling Approach to Conspiracy Theories on Telegram](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08642v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. However, existing research often neglects visual content beyond memes, and in addition lacks methods to compare topic models across modalities. Our study addresses these gaps by applying multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. We use BERTopic with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data in a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories. Through this dataset, we provide insights into unimodal and multimodal topic models by analyzing symmetry and intersections of topics across modalities. We demonstrate the variety of textual and visual content shared in the channels discovered through the topic modeling, and propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of textual and visual discursive strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories. We apply the framework in a case study of the topic group Israel Gaza.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Protecting multimodal large language models against misleading visualizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20503v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We assess the vulnerability of multimodal large language models to misleading visualizations - charts that distort the underlying data using techniques such as truncated or inverted axes, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions that may support misinformation or conspiracy theories. Our analysis shows that these distortions severely harm multimodal large language models, reducing their question-answering accuracy to the level of the random baseline. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce six inference-time methods to improve performance of MLLMs on misleading visualizations while preserving their accuracy on non-misleading ones. The most effective approach involves (1) extracting the underlying data table and (2) using a text-only large language model to answer questions based on the table. This method improves performance on misleading visualizations by 15.4 to 19.6 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Multimodal Action Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09444v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action quality assessment (AQA) is to assess how well an action is performed. Previous works perform modelling by only the use of visual information, ignoring audio information. We argue that although AQA is highly dependent on visual information, the audio is useful complementary information for improving the score regression accuracy, especially for sports with background music, such as figure skating and rhythmic gymnastics. To leverage multimodal information for AQA, i.e., RGB, optical flow and audio information, we propose a Progressive Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Network (PAMFN) that separately models modality-specific information and mixed-modality information. Our model consists of with three modality-specific branches that independently explore modality-specific information and a mixed-modality branch that progressively aggregates the modality-specific information from the modality-specific branches. To build the bridge between modality-specific branches and the mixed-modality branch, three novel modules are proposed. First, a Modality-specific Feature Decoder module is designed to selectively transfer modality-specific information to the mixed-modality branch. Second, when exploring the interaction between modality-specific information, we argue that using an invariant multimodal fusion policy may lead to suboptimal results, so as to take the potential diversity in different parts of an action into consideration. Therefore, an Adaptive Fusion Module is proposed to learn adaptive multimodal fusion policies in different parts of an action. This module consists of several FusionNets for exploring different multimodal fusion strategies and a PolicyNet for deciding which FusionNets are enabled. Third, a module called Cross-modal Feature Decoder is designed to transfer cross-modal features generated by Adaptive Fusion Module to the mixed-modality branch.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2024</p></details> |
| **[Mineral segmentation using electron microscope images and spectral sampling through multimodal graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03507v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based method for segmentation based on data fusion of multimodal Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. In most cases, Backscattered Electron (BSE) images obtained using SEM do not contain sufficient information for mineral segmentation. Therefore, imaging is often complemented with point-wise Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) spectral measurements that provide highly accurate information about the chemical composition but that are time-consuming to acquire. This motivates the use of sparse spectral data in conjunction with BSE images for mineral segmentation. The unstructured nature of the spectral data makes most traditional image fusion techniques unsuitable for BSE-EDS fusion. We propose using graph neural networks to fuse the two modalities and segment the mineral phases simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that providing EDS data for as few as 1% of BSE pixels produces accurate segmentation, enabling rapid analysis of mineral samples. The proposed data fusion pipeline is versatile and can be adapted to other domains that involve image data and point-wise measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[iNews: A Multimodal Dataset for Modeling Personalized Affective Responses to News](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03335v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches to emotion detection often overlook the inherent subjectivity of affective experiences, instead relying on aggregated labels that mask individual variations in emotional responses. We introduce iNews, a novel large-scale dataset explicitly capturing subjective affective responses to news headlines. Our dataset comprises annotations from 291 demographically diverse UK participants across 2,899 multimodal Facebook news posts from major UK outlets, with an average of 5.18 annotators per sample. For each post, annotators provide multifaceted labels including valence, arousal, dominance, discrete emotions, content relevance judgments, sharing likelihood, and modality importance ratings (text, image, or both). Furthermore, we collect comprehensive annotator persona information covering demographics, personality, media trust, and consumption patterns, which explain 15.2% of annotation variance - higher than existing NLP datasets. Incorporating this information yields a 7% accuracy gain in zero-shot prediction and remains beneficial even with 32-shot. iNews will enhance research in LLM personalization, subjectivity, affective computing, and individual-level behavior simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[See What You Are Told: Visual Attention Sink in Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03321v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) "see" images by leveraging the attention mechanism between text and visual tokens in the transformer decoder. Ideally, these models should focus on key visual information relevant to the text token. However, recent findings indicate that LMMs have an extraordinary tendency to consistently allocate high attention weights to specific visual tokens, even when these tokens are irrelevant to the corresponding text. In this study, we investigate the property behind the appearance of these irrelevant visual tokens and examine their characteristics. Our findings show that this behavior arises due to the massive activation of certain hidden state dimensions, which resembles the attention sink found in language models. Hence, we refer to this phenomenon as the visual attention sink. In particular, our analysis reveals that removing the irrelevant visual sink tokens does not impact model performance, despite receiving high attention weights. Consequently, we recycle the attention to these tokens as surplus resources, redistributing the attention budget to enhance focus on the image. To achieve this, we introduce Visual Attention Redistribution (VAR), a method that redistributes attention in image-centric heads, which we identify as innately focusing on visual information. VAR can be seamlessly applied across different LMMs to improve performance on a wide range of tasks, including general vision-language tasks, visual hallucination tasks, and vision-centric tasks, all without the need for additional training, models, or inference steps. Experimental results demonstrate that VAR enables LMMs to process visual information more effectively by adjusting their internal attention mechanisms, offering a new direction to enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LMMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEVMOSNet: Multimodal Fusion for BEV Moving Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03280v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion understanding of the dynamic objects within the scene in bird's-eye-view (BEV) is critical to ensure a reliable obstacle avoidance system and smooth path planning for autonomous vehicles. However, this task has received relatively limited exploration when compared to object detection and segmentation with only a few recent vision-based approaches presenting preliminary findings that significantly deteriorate in low-light, nighttime, and adverse weather conditions such as rain. Conversely, LiDAR and radar sensors remain almost unaffected in these scenarios, and radar provides key velocity information of the objects. Therefore, we introduce BEVMOSNet, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end multimodal fusion leveraging cameras, LiDAR, and radar to precisely predict the moving objects in BEV. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis to find out the optimal strategy for deformable cross-attention-guided sensor fusion for cross-sensor knowledge sharing in BEV. While evaluating BEVMOSNet on the nuScenes dataset, we show an overall improvement in IoU score of 36.59% compared to the vision-based unimodal baseline BEV-MoSeg (Sigatapu et al., 2023), and 2.35% compared to the multimodel SimpleBEV (Harley et al., 2022), extended for the motion segmentation task, establishing this method as the state-of-the-art in BEV motion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (2025)</p></details> |
| **[ChemVLM: Exploring the Power of Multimodal Large Language Models in Chemistry Area](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07246v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks.

Traditional approaches, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs), often struggle to infer complex contextual relationships or deliver comprehensive intelligence from unstructured data sources. In this paper, we introduce COSINT-Agent, a knowledge-driven multimodal agent tailored to address the challenges of OSINT in the Chinese domain. COSINT-Agent seamlessly integrates the perceptual capabilities of fine-tuned MLLMs with the structured reasoning power of the Entity-Event-Scene Knowledge Graph (EES-KG). Central to COSINT-Agent is the innovative EES-Match framework, which bridges COSINT-MLLM and EES-KG, enabling systematic extraction, reasoning, and contextualization of multimodal insights. This integration facilitates precise entity recognition, event interpretation, and context retrieval, effectively transforming raw multimodal data into actionable intelligence. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of COSINT-Agent across core OSINT tasks, including entity recognition, EES generation, and context matching. These results underscore its potential as a robust and scalable solution for advancing automated multimodal reasoning and enhancing the effectiveness of OSINT methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variance-Aware Loss Scheduling for Multimodal Alignment in Low-Data Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03202v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training vision-language models for image-text alignment typically requires large datasets to achieve robust performance. In low-data scenarios, standard contrastive learning can struggle to align modalities effectively due to overfitting and unstable training dynamics. In this paper, we propose a variance-aware loss scheduling approach that dynamically adjusts the weighting of the contrastive loss based on the statistical variability (uncertainty) in the model's alignment predictions. Using a subset of the Flickr8k image-caption dataset to simulate limited data conditions, we demonstrate that our approach improves image-text retrieval accuracy compared to a fixed-weight baseline. We also compare against other adaptive weighting strategies (using output entropy and cosine similarity spread) and find that variance-aware scheduling provides the best overall trade-off. Qualitatively, our method yields more distinct multimodal embeddings as shown by t-SNE visualizations. Moreover, in a stress test with noise-injected captions and images, the variance-guided loss proves more robust, maintaining higher recall when random perturbations are introduced. These results highlight the benefit of adaptive loss weighting for multimodal alignment in low-data regimes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

A promising solution to mitigate this issue is to generate text with citations, providing a transparent chain for verification. However, existing work primarily focuses on generating citations for text-only content, overlooking the challenges and opportunities of multimodal contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MCiteBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the multimodal citation text generation ability of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises data derived from academic papers and review-rebuttal interactions, featuring diverse information sources and multimodal content. We comprehensively evaluate models from multiple dimensions, including citation quality, source reliability, and answer accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs struggle with multimodal citation text generation. We also conduct deep analyses of models' performance, revealing that the bottleneck lies in attributing the correct sources rather than understanding the multimodal content.</p></details> |  |

A "visual analogy" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the "what" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the "how" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-o1, performs better in tasks involving simple surface-level visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of extrinsic spatial properties in the physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

However, we find that MM-RMs trained on existing datasets often struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution data due to their reliance on unimodal spurious correlations, primarily text-only shortcuts within the training distribution, which prevents them from leveraging true multimodal reward functions. To address this, we introduce a Shortcut-aware MM-RM learning algorithm that mitigates this issue by dynamically reweighting training samples, shifting the distribution toward better multimodal understanding, and reducing dependence on unimodal spurious correlations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, downstream task performance, and scalability, establishing a more robust framework for multimodal reward modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[External Reliable Information-enhanced Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03107v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of the Internet, the information dissemination paradigm has changed and the efficiency has been improved greatly. While this also brings the quick spread of fake news and leads to negative impacts on cyberspace. Currently, the information presentation formats have evolved gradually, with the news formats shifting from texts to multimodal contents. As a result, detecting multimodal fake news has become one of the research hotspots. However, multimodal fake news detection research field still faces two main challenges: the inability to fully and effectively utilize multimodal information for detection, and the low credibility or static nature of the introduced external information, which limits dynamic updates. To bridge the gaps, we propose ERIC-FND, an external reliable information-enhanced multimodal contrastive learning framework for fake news detection. ERIC-FND strengthens the representation of news contents by entity-enriched external information enhancement method. It also enriches the multimodal news information via multimodal semantic interaction method where the multimodal constrative learning is employed to make different modality representations learn from each other. Moreover, an adaptive fusion method is taken to integrate the news representations from different dimensions for the eventual classification. Experiments are done on two commonly used datasets in different languages, X (Twitter) and Weibo. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed model ERIC-FND outperforms existing state-of-the-art fake news detection methods under the same settings.</p></details> | accepted by AAAI'25 |
| **[Enhancing Multi-Robot Semantic Navigation Through Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Score Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18292v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how humans cooperatively utilize semantic knowledge to explore unfamiliar environments and decide on navigation directions is critical for house service multi-robot systems. Previous methods primarily focused on single-robot centralized planning strategies, which severely limited exploration efficiency. Recent research has considered decentralized planning strategies for multiple robots, assigning separate planning models to each robot, but these approaches often overlook communication costs. In this work, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Co-Navigation (MCoCoNav), a modular approach that utilizes multimodal Chain-of-Thought to plan collaborative semantic navigation for multiple robots. MCoCoNav combines visual perception with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to evaluate exploration value through probabilistic scoring, thus reducing time costs and achieving stable outputs. Additionally, a global semantic map is used as a communication bridge, minimizing communication overhead while integrating observational results. Guided by scores that reflect exploration trends, robots utilize this map to assess whether to explore new frontier points or revisit history nodes. Experiments on HM3D_v0.2 and MP3D demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/FrankZxShen/MCoCoNav.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, Extended Version of accepted AAAI 2025 Paper</p></details> |

An Analysis of 34K Smartphone Screenshots with Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11354v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smartphone users often regret aspects of their phone use, especially social media use. However, pinpointing specific ways in which the design of an interface contributes to regrettable use can be challenging due to the complexity of social media app features and user intentions. We conducted a one-week study with 17 Android users, using a novel method where we passively collected screenshots every five seconds, which we analyzed via a multimodal large language model to understand participants' usage activity at a fine-grained level. Triangulating this data with data from experience sampling, surveys, and interviews, we found that regret varies based on user intention, with non-intentional and social media use being especially regrettable. Regret also varies by social media activity; participants were most likely to regret viewing algorithmically recommended content and comments. Additionally, participants frequently deviated to browsing social media when their intention was direct communication, which slightly increased their regret. Our findings provide guidance to designers and policy-makers seeking to improve users' experience and autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a CHI 2025 Full Paper</p></details> |

Traditional classification approaches rely on either histopathological images or gene expression profiling, limiting their predictive power. In this study, we propose a deep multimodal learning framework that integrates histopathological images and gene expression data to classify breast cancer into BRCA.Luminal and BRCA.Basal / Her2 subtypes. Our approach employs a ResNet-50 model for image feature extraction and fully connected layers for gene expression processing, with a cross-attention fusion mechanism to enhance modality interaction. We conduct extensive experiments using five-fold cross-validation, demonstrating that our multimodal integration outperforms unimodal approaches in terms of classification accuracy, precision-recall AUC, and F1-score. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning for robust and interpretable breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

This article explores multimodal generative models capable of converting taste information into music, building on this foundational research. We provide a brief review of the state of the art in this field, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We present an experiment in which a fine-tuned version of a generative music model (MusicGEN) is used to generate music based on detailed taste descriptions provided for each musical piece. The results are promising: according the participants' ($n=111$) evaluation, the fine-tuned model produces music that more coherently reflects the input taste descriptions compared to the non-fine-tuned model. This study represents a significant step towards understanding and developing embodied interactions between AI, sound, and taste, opening new possibilities in the field of generative AI.

| **[Smoothing the Shift: Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation under Complex Multimodal Noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02616v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to tackle distribution shifts using unlabeled test data without access to the source data. In the context of multimodal data, there are more complex noise patterns than unimodal data such as simultaneous corruptions for multiple modalities and missing modalities. Besides, in real-world applications, corruptions from different distribution shifts are always mixed. Existing TTA methods always fail in such multimodal scenario because the abrupt distribution shifts will destroy the prior knowledge from the source model, thus leading to performance degradation. To this end, we reveal a new challenge named multimodal wild TTA. To address this challenging problem, we propose two novel strategies: sample identification with interquartile range Smoothing and unimodal assistance, and Mutual information sharing (SuMi). SuMi smooths the adaptation process by interquartile range which avoids the abrupt distribution shifts. Then, SuMi fully utilizes the unimodal features to select low-entropy samples with rich multimodal information for optimization. Furthermore, mutual information sharing is introduced to align the information, reduce the discrepancies and enhance the information utilization across different modalities. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the effectiveness and superiority over existing methods under the complex noise patterns in multimodal data.

However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs. Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs. Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text). To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens. This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time. Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sony/aki, and we will release our AKI-4B model to encourage further advancements in MLLMs across various directions.</p></details> | Preprint |

Current datasets fall short in scale, realism and do not capture the multimodal nature of OR scenes, limiting progress in OR modeling. To this end, we introduce MM-OR, a realistic and large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal OR dataset, and the first dataset to enable multimodal scene graph generation. MM-OR captures comprehensive OR scenes containing RGB-D data, detail views, audio, speech transcripts, robotic logs, and tracking data and is annotated with panoptic segmentations, semantic scene graphs, and downstream task labels. Further, we propose MM2SG, the first multimodal large vision-language model for scene graph generation, and through extensive experiments, demonstrate its ability to effectively leverage multimodal inputs. Together, MM-OR and MM2SG establish a new benchmark for holistic OR understanding, and open the path towards multimodal scene analysis in complex, high-stakes environments. Our code, and data is available at https://github.com/egeozsoy/MM-OR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR): A New Benchmark for Multimodal Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16033v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching Metric Distance to Autoregressive Multimodal Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02379v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are pronounced in cases of limited training data, highlighting DIST2Loss's effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[DivPrune: Diversity-based Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02175v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have emerged as powerful models capable of understanding various data modalities, including text, images, and videos. LMMs encode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and processed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens substantially increases the total token count, often by thousands. The increased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of inference, resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue, token pruning methods, which remove part of the visual tokens, are proposed. The existing token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and fine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased redundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper, we first formulate token pruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a subset such that the diversity among the selected {tokens} is maximized. Then, we solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The proposed method, DivPrune, reduces redundancy and achieves the highest diversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity, the selected tokens better represent the original tokens, enabling effective performance even at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets. Additionally, DivPrune reduces both the end-to-end latency and GPU memory usage for the tested models. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/vbdi/divprune}{\text{here}}$.</p></details> |  |

Our experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness in two key areas: (1) LMM-as-a-Judge, where LLaVA-Critic provides reliable evaluation scores, performing on par with or surpassing GPT models on multiple evaluation benchmarks; and (2) Preference Learning, where it generates reward signals for preference learning, enhancing model alignment capabilities. This work underscores the potential of open-source LMMs in self-critique and evaluation, setting the stage for future research into scalable, superhuman alignment feedback mechanisms for LMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025; Project Page: https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-10-03-llava-critic</p></details> |

This study investigates the use of multimodal data sources -- including eye-tracking data, learning outcomes, assessment content, and teaching standards -- to derive meaningful reading insights. We employ unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct reading behavior patterns, and then a large language model (LLM) synthesizes the derived information into actionable reports for educators, streamlining the interpretation process. LLM experts and human educators evaluate these reports for clarity, accuracy, relevance, and pedagogical usefulness. Our findings indicate that LLMs can effectively function as educational analysts, turning diverse data into teacher-friendly insights that are well-received by educators. While promising for automating insight generation, human oversight remains crucial to ensure reliability and fairness. This research advances human-centered AI in education, connecting data-driven analytics with practical classroom applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Current multimodal models primarily focus on simpler tasks (e.g., VQA, VideoQA, video-text retrieval) and often neglect the more challenging conversational counterparts, such as video and visual/image dialog. Moreover, works on both conversational tasks evolved separately from each other despite their apparent similarities limiting their applicability potential. To this end, we propose to unify both tasks using a single model that for the first time jointly learns the spatial and temporal features of images and videos by routing them through dedicated experts and aligns them using matching and contrastive learning techniques. Furthermore, we systemically study the domain shift between the two tasks by investigating whether and to what extent these seemingly related tasks can mutually benefit from their respective training data. Extensive evaluations on the widely used video and visual dialog datasets of AVSD and VisDial show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks both in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Our model, ReT, employs multi-level representations extracted from different layers of both visual and textual backbones, both at the query and document side. To allow for multi-level and cross-modal understanding and feature extraction, ReT employs a novel Transformer-based recurrent cell that integrates both textual and visual features at different layers, and leverages sigmoidal gates inspired by the classical design of LSTMs. Extensive experiments on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks show that ReT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings.

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</p></details> | 39 pages |
| **[A Shared Encoder Approach to Multimodal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01654v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal representation learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in enabling models to process and integrate diverse data modalities, such as text and images, for improved understanding and performance. While the medical domain can benefit significantly from this paradigm, the scarcity of paired multimodal data and reliance on proprietary or pretrained encoders pose significant challenges. In this work, we present a shared encoder framework for multimodal representation learning tailored to the medical domain. Our approach employs a single set of encoder parameters shared across modalities, augmented with learnable modality features. Empirical results demonstrate that our shared encoder idea achieves superior performance compared to separate modality-specific encoders, demonstrating improved generalization in data-constrained settings. Notably, the performance gains are more pronounced with fewer training examples, underscoring the efficiency of our shared encoder framework for real-world medical applications with limited data.

| **[Distilled Prompt Learning for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01653v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of multimodal data including pathology images and gene profiles is widely applied in precise survival prediction. Despite recent advances in multimodal survival models, collecting complete modalities for multimodal fusion still poses a significant challenge, hindering their application in clinical settings. Current approaches tackling incomplete modalities often fall short, as they typically compensate for only a limited part of the knowledge of missing modalities. To address this issue, we propose a Distilled Prompt Learning framework (DisPro) to utilize the strong robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to missing modalities, which employs two-stage prompting for compensation of comprehensive information for missing modalities. In the first stage, Unimodal Prompting (UniPro) distills the knowledge distribution of each modality, preparing for supplementing modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality in the subsequent stage. In the second stage, Multimodal Prompting (MultiPro) leverages available modalities as prompts for LLMs to infer the missing modality, which provides modality-common information. Simultaneously, the unimodal knowledge acquired in the first stage is injected into multimodal inference to compensate for the modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality. Extensive experiments covering various missing scenarios demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/Innse/DisPro.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Moreover, food is inextricably linked to people's lives, making it a vital research area for practical applications such as dietary management. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, not only in their vast knowledge but also in their ability to handle languages naturally. While English is predominantly used, they can also support multiple languages including Japanese. This suggests that MLLMs are expected to significantly improve performance in food image understanding tasks. We fine-tuned open MLLMs LLaVA-1.5 and Phi-3 Vision on a Japanese recipe dataset and benchmarked their performance against the closed model GPT-4o. We then evaluated the content of generated recipes, including ingredients and cooking procedures, using 5,000 evaluation samples that comprehensively cover Japanese food culture. Our evaluation demonstrates that the open models trained on recipe data outperform GPT-4o, the current state-of-the-art model, in ingredient generation. Our model achieved F1 score of 0.531, surpassing GPT-4o's F1 score of 0.481, indicating a higher level of accuracy. Furthermore, our model exhibited comparable performance to GPT-4o in generating cooking procedure text.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures.

Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Therefore, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation. MIGE introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: By leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: Learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a state-of-the-art in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Late Breaking Work (CHI'25 LBW)</p></details> |

Early detection is crucial for timely interventions that may slow disease progression. Large pre-trained models (LPMs) for text and audio, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), have shown promise in identifying cognitive impairments. However, existing studies generally rely heavily on expert-annotated datasets and unimodal approaches, limiting robustness and scalability. This study proposes a context-based multimodal method, integrating both text and audio data using the best-performing LPMs in each modality. By incorporating contextual embeddings, our method improves dementia detection performance. Additionally, motivated by the effectiveness of contextual embeddings, we further experimented with a context-based In-Context Learning (ICL) as a complementary technique. Results show that GPT-based embeddings, particularly when fused with CLAP audio features, achieve an F1-score of $83.33\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art dementia detection models. Furthermore, raw text data outperforms expert-annotated datasets, demonstrating that LPMs can extract meaningful linguistic and acoustic patterns without extensive manual labeling. These findings highlight the potential for scalable, non-invasive diagnostic tools that reduce reliance on costly annotations while maintaining high accuracy. By integrating multimodal learning with contextual embeddings, this work lays the foundation for future advancements in personalized dementia detection and cognitive health research.</p></details> |  |

While the existing methods have made strides in gesture accuracy, challenges remain in generating diverse and coherent gestures, as most approaches assume independence among multimodal inputs and lack explicit modeling of their interactions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning method named HOP for co-speech gesture generation that captures the heterogeneous entanglement between gesture motion, audio rhythm, and text semantics, enabling the generation of coordinated gestures. By leveraging spatiotemporal graph modeling, we achieve the alignment of audio and action. Moreover, to enhance modality coherence, we build the audio-text semantic representation based on a reprogramming module, which is beneficial for cross-modality adaptation. Our approach enables the trimodal system to learn each other's features and represent them in the form of topological entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HOP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering more natural and expressive co-speech gesture generation.

With advances in multimodal generative models, a natural solution is to generate synthetic samples with subtle variations for training VLMs. However, generating and training on synthetic samples with subtle variations presents two challenges: difficulty in accurately creating precise variations and inconsistency in cross-modal alignment quality. To address these challenges, we propose SVD-GT (Subtle Variation Data Generation and Training), which integrates image feature injection into a text-to-image generative model to enhance the quality of synthetic variations and employs an adaptive margin loss to differentiate samples using adaptive margins, which help filter out potentially incorrect synthetic samples and focus the learning on informative hard samples. Evaluations on four compositional understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SVD-GT significantly improves the compositionality of VLMs, boosting the average accuracy of CLIP by over 8% across all benchmarks and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2% on three benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

In this work, we introduce WeGen, a model that unifies multimodal generation and understanding, and promotes their interplay in iterative generation. It can generate diverse results with high creativity for less detailed instructions. And it can progressively refine prior generation results or integrating specific contents from references following the instructions in its chat with users. During this process, it is capable of preserving consistency in the parts that the user is already satisfied with. To this end, we curate a large-scale dataset, extracted from Internet videos, containing rich object dynamics and auto-labeled dynamics descriptions by advanced foundation models to date. These two information are interleaved into a single sequence to enable WeGen to learn consistency-aware generation where the specified dynamics are generated while the consistency of unspecified content is preserved aligned with instructions. Besides, we introduce a prompt self-rewriting mechanism to enhance generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of unifying multimodal understanding and generation in WeGen and show it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various visual generation benchmarks. These also demonstrate the potential of WeGen as a user-friendly design copilot as desired. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/hzphzp/WeGen.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, one-point representation has difficulty in capturing the relationship and the similarity structure of a huge amount of instances in the real world. For richer classes of the similarity, we propose the use of weighted point sets, namely, sets of pairs of weight and vector, as representations of instances. In this work, we theoretically show the benefit of our proposed method through a new understanding of the contrastive loss of CLIP, which we call symmetric InfoNCE. We clarify that the optimal similarity that minimizes symmetric InfoNCE is the pointwise mutual information, and show an upper bound of excess risk on downstream classification tasks of representations that achieve the optimal similarity. In addition, we show that our proposed similarity based on weighted point sets consistently achieves the optimal similarity. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we demonstrate pretraining of text-image representation models and classification tasks on common benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies.

Many studies have tackled this problem by using different sets of information available about the materials. Among them, multimodal approaches have been found to be promising because of their ability to combine different sources of information. However, fusion algorithms to date remain simple, lacking a mechanism to provide a rich representation of multiple modalities. This paper presents LLM-Fusion, a novel multimodal fusion model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to integrate diverse representations, such as SMILES, SELFIES, text descriptions, and molecular fingerprints, for accurate property prediction. Our approach introduces a flexible LLM-based architecture that supports multimodal input processing and enables material property prediction with higher accuracy than traditional methods. We validate our model on two datasets across five prediction tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to unimodal and naive concatenation baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, presented at AAAI 2025 Workshop on AI to Accelerating Science and Engineering (AI2ASE)</p></details> |
| **[LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One Vision Token](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03895v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Existing detection methods typically rely on fusion effectiveness and cross-modal consistency to model the content, complicating understanding how each modality affects prediction accuracy. Additionally, these methods are primarily based on static feature modelling, making it difficult to adapt to the dynamic changes and relationships between different data modalities. This paper develops a significantly novel approach, GAMED, for multimodal modelling, which focuses on generating distinctive and discriminative features through modal decoupling to enhance cross-modal synergies, thereby optimizing overall performance in the detection process. GAMED leverages multiple parallel expert networks to refine features and pre-embed semantic knowledge to improve the experts' ability in information selection and viewpoint sharing. Subsequently, the feature distribution of each modality is adaptively adjusted based on the respective experts' opinions. GAMED also introduces a novel classification technique to dynamically manage contributions from different modalities, while improving the explainability of decisions. Experimental results on the Fakeddit and Yang datasets demonstrate that GAMED performs better than recently developed state-of-the-art models.

| **[Multimodal Distillation-Driven Ensemble Learning for Long-Tailed Histopathology Whole Slide Images Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00915v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) plays a significant role in computational pathology, enabling weakly supervised analysis of Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets. The field of WSI analysis is confronted with a severe long-tailed distribution problem, which significantly impacts the performance of classifiers. Long-tailed distributions lead to class imbalance, where some classes have sparse samples while others are abundant, making it difficult for classifiers to accurately identify minority class samples. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble learning method based on MIL, which employs expert decoders with shared aggregators and consistency constraints to learn diverse distributions and reduce the impact of class imbalance on classifier performance. Moreover, we introduce a multimodal distillation framework that leverages text encoders pre-trained on pathology-text pairs to distill knowledge and guide the MIL aggregator in capturing stronger semantic features relevant to class information. To ensure flexibility, we use learnable prompts to guide the distillation process of the pre-trained text encoder, avoiding limitations imposed by specific prompts. Our method, MDE-MIL, integrates multiple expert branches focusing on specific data distributions to address long-tailed issues. Consistency control ensures generalization across classes. Multimodal distillation enhances feature extraction. Experiments on Camelyon+-LT and PANDA-LT datasets show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these correlations often exhibit a high-dimensional and strongly nonlinear nature, which makes them challenging to detect using standard methods. This paper exploits the entanglement between intrinsic dimensionality and correlation to propose a metric that quantifies the (potentially nonlinear) correlation between high-dimensional manifolds. We first validate our method on synthetic data in controlled environments, showcasing its advantages and drawbacks compared to existing techniques. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to large-scale applications in neural network representations. Specifically, we focus on latent representations of multimodal data, uncovering clear correlations between paired visual and textual embeddings, whereas existing methods struggle significantly in detecting similarity. Our results indicate the presence of highly nonlinear correlation patterns between latent manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, there remains a gap between its capability and the real-world applicability, primarily due to the model's limited capacity to effectively respond to various user instructions and interact with diverse visual data. In this work, we focus on bridging this gap through integrating two enhanced features: (1) comprehending images of arbitrary sizes and ratios, and (2) enabling multi-granularity image generation. We present a unified and versatile foundation model, namely, SEED-X, which is able to model multi-granularity visual semantics for comprehension and generation tasks. Besides the competitive results on public benchmarks, SEED-X demonstrates its effectiveness in handling real-world applications across various domains after instruction tuning. We hope that our work will inspire future research into what can be achieved by versatile multimodal foundation models in real-world applications.

Existing methods, however, ignore the resolution adaptability needs of different tasks, which hinders them to find out precise language descriptions. In this study, we propose a DynRefer approach, to pursue high-accuracy region-level referring through mimicking the resolution adaptability of human visual cognition. During training, DynRefer stochastically aligns language descriptions of multimodal tasks with images of multiple resolutions, which are constructed by nesting a set of random views around the referred region. During inference, DynRefer performs selectively multimodal referring by sampling proper region representations for tasks from the nested views based on image and task priors. This allows the visual information for referring to better match human preferences, thereby improving the representational adaptability of region-level multimodal models. Experiments show that DynRefer brings mutual improvement upon broad tasks including region-level captioning, open-vocabulary region recognition and attribute detection. Furthermore, DynRefer achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple region-level multimodal tasks using a single model.

| **[Re-Imagining Multimodal Instruction Tuning: A Representation View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00723v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal instruction tuning has proven to be an effective strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by fine-tuning pre-trained Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with instruction-following data. However, as the scale of LMMs continues to grow, fully fine-tuning these models has become highly parameter-intensive. Although Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced to reduce the number of tunable parameters, a significant performance gap remains compared to full fine-tuning. Furthermore, existing PEFT approaches are often highly parameterized, making them difficult to interpret and control. In light of this, we introduce Multimodal Representation Tuning (MRT), a novel approach that focuses on directly editing semantically rich multimodal representations to achieve strong performance and provide intuitive control over LMMs. Empirical results show that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines with significant performance gains (e.g., 1580.40 MME score) while requiring substantially fewer tunable parameters (e.g., 0.03% parameters). Additionally, we conduct experiments on editing instrumental tokens within multimodal representations, demonstrating that direct manipulation of these representations enables simple yet effective control over network behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFG-Flow: Training-free Guidance in Multimodal Generative Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14216v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Urban Safety Perception Through the Lens of Large Multimodal Models: A Persona-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00610v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban environments are perceived in terms of safety is crucial for urban planning and policymaking. Traditional methods like surveys are limited by high cost, required time, and scalability issues. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), specifically Llava 1.6 7B, as a novel approach to assess safety perceptions of urban spaces using street-view images. In addition, the research investigated how this task is affected by different socio-demographic perspectives, simulated by the model through Persona-based prompts. Without additional fine-tuning, the model achieved an average F1-score of 59.21% in classifying urban scenarios as safe or unsafe, identifying three key drivers of perceived unsafety: isolation, physical decay, and urban infrastructural challenges. Moreover, incorporating Persona-based prompts revealed significant variations in safety perceptions across the socio-demographic groups of age, gender, and nationality. Elder and female Personas consistently perceive higher levels of unsafety than younger or male Personas. Similarly, nationality-specific differences were evident in the proportion of unsafe classifications ranging from 19.71% in Singapore to 40.15% in Botswana. Notably, the model's default configuration aligned most closely with a middle-aged, male Persona. These findings highlight the potential of LMMs as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for urban safety perceptions. While the sensitivity of these models to socio-demographic factors underscores the need for thoughtful deployment, their ability to provide nuanced perspectives makes them a promising tool for AI-driven urban planning.</p></details> |  |

The clinical decision-making of cardiotoxicity is challenging, as non-clinical symptoms can be missed until life-threatening events occur at a later stage, and clinicians already have a high workload centered on the treatment, not the side effects. Our project starts with a participatory design study with 11 clinicians to understand their practices and needs; then we build a multimodal AI system, CardioAI, that integrates wearables and LLM-powered voice assistants to monitor multimodal non-clinical symptoms. Also, the system includes an explainable risk prediction module that can generate cardiotoxicity risk scores and summaries as explanations to support clinicians' decision-making. We conducted a heuristic evaluation with four clinical experts and found that they all believe CardioAI integrates well into their workflow, reduces their information overload, and enables them to make more informed decisions.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of improving user experiences in complex systems with search and recommendation (S\&R) services has drawn significant attention from both academia and industry these years. However, the lack of high-quality datasets has limited the research progress on multimodal S\&R. To address the growing need for developing better S\&R services, we present a novel multimodal information retrieval dataset in this paper, namely Qilin. The dataset is collected from Xiaohongshu, a popular social platform with over 300 million monthly active users and an average search penetration rate of over 70\%. In contrast to existing datasets, \textsf{Qilin} offers a comprehensive collection of user sessions with heterogeneous results like image-text notes, video notes, commercial notes, and direct answers, facilitating the development of advanced multimodal neural retrieval models across diverse task settings. To better model user satisfaction and support the analysis of heterogeneous user behaviors, we also collect extensive APP-level contextual signals and genuine user feedback. Notably, Qilin contains user-favored answers and their referred results for search requests triggering the Deep Query Answering (DQA) module. This allows not only the training \& evaluation of a Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, but also the exploration of how such a module would affect users' search behavior. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we provide interesting findings and insights for further improving S\&R systems. We hope that \textsf{Qilin} will significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal content platforms with S\&R services in the future.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Many studies aim to build the underlying connections among different modalities via the alignment and mappings at the token or embedding level, but so far, most methods are very data-hungry, limiting their performance in domains such as music where paired data are less abundant. We argue that the embedding alignment is only at the surface level of multimodal alignment. In this paper, we propose a grand challenge of \textit{language model mapping} (LMM), i.e., how to map the essence implied in the LM of one domain to the LM of another domain under the assumption that LMs of different modalities are tracking the same underlying phenomena. We first introduce a basic setup of LMM, highlighting the goal to unveil a deeper aspect of cross-modal alignment as well as to achieve more sample-efficiency learning. We then discuss why music is an ideal domain in which to conduct LMM research. After that, we connect LMM in music with a more general and challenging scientific problem of \textit{learning to take actions based on both sensory input and abstract symbols}, and in the end, present an advanced version of the challenge problem setup.</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid pace of knowledge updates in the real world makes offline training of MLLMs costly, and when faced with non-stationary data streams, MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting during learning. In this paper, we propose an MLLMs-based dual momentum Mixture-of-Experts (CL-MoE) framework for continual visual question answering (VQA). We integrate MLLMs with continual learning to utilize the rich commonsense knowledge in LLMs. We introduce a Dual-Router MoE (RMoE) strategy to select the global and local experts using task-level and instance-level routers, to robustly assign weights to the experts most appropriate for the task. Then, we design a dynamic Momentum MoE (MMoE) to update the parameters of experts dynamically based on the relationships between the experts and tasks/instances, so that the model can absorb new knowledge while maintaining existing knowledge. The extensive experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 VQA tasks, proving the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,4 figures,accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |

We propose a novel image compression framework, Semantically Disentangled Image Compression (SEDIC) in this paper. Our proposed SEDIC leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) to disentangle the image into several essential semantic information, including an extremely compressed reference image, overall and object-level text descriptions, and the semantic masks. A multi-stage semantic decoder is designed to progressively restore the transmitted reference image object-by-object, ultimately producing high-quality and perceptually consistent reconstructions. In each decoding stage, a pre-trained controllable diffusion model is utilized to restore the object details on the reference image conditioned by the text descriptions and semantic masks. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at ultra-low bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal knowledge editing primarily focus on entity-level knowledge represented as simple triplets, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world multimodal information. To address this issue, we introduce MMKE-Bench, a comprehensive MultiModal Knowledge Editing Benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to edit diverse visual knowledge in real-world scenarios. MMKE-Bench addresses these limitations by incorporating three types of editing tasks: visual entity editing, visual semantic editing, and user-specific editing. Besides, MMKE-Bench uses free-form natural language to represent and edit knowledge, offering a more flexible and effective format. The benchmark consists of 2,940 pieces of knowledge and 8,363 images across 33 broad categories, with evaluation questions automatically generated and human-verified. We assess five state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods on three prominent LMMs, revealing that no method excels across all criteria, and that visual and user-specific edits are particularly challenging. MMKE-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating the robustness of multimodal knowledge editing techniques, driving progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ICLR2025.

However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate a multimodal embedding model, which outputs embeddings that combine visual and natural language input. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves bestfor-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of multimodal embeddings by offering high-quality representations and flexible natural language control.

This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time (R2-T2)" that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, as the length of the video increases, generating long, detailed captions becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of LMMs in generating long captions for long videos. Our analysis reveals that open-source LMMs struggle to consistently produce outputs exceeding 300 words, leading to incomplete or overly concise descriptions of the visual content. This limitation hinders the ability of LMMs to provide comprehensive and detailed captions for long videos, ultimately missing important visual information. Through controlled experiments, we find that the scarcity of paired examples with long-captions during training is the primary factor limiting the model's output length. However, manually annotating long-caption examples for long-form videos is time-consuming and expensive. To overcome the annotation bottleneck, we propose the LongCaption-Agent, a framework that synthesizes long caption data by hierarchical semantic aggregation. % aggregating multi-level descriptions. Using LongCaption-Agent, we curated a new long-caption dataset, LongCaption-10K. We also develop LongCaption-Bench, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the quality of long captions generated by LMMs. By incorporating LongCaption-10K into training, we enable LMMs to generate captions exceeding 1,000 words for long-form videos, while maintaining high output quality. In LongCaption-Bench, our model achieved State-of-The-Art performance, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT4o.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can process both visual and textual data, presents an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning tasks within a single framework. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a novel framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving systems by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce the Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss function, designed to improve the accuracy of low-level control signal predictions when numerical values are represented as text. Second, to ensure safe autonomous driving by explicitly integrating precise safety knowledge into the MLLM, we develop a reasoning component for SafeAuto. This component translates driving safety regulations into first-order logic rules (e.g., "red light => stop") and incorporates these rules into a probabilistic graphical model, such as a Markov Logic Network (MLN). The MLN is trained to verify the predicted next actions using environmental attributes identified by attribute recognition models (e.g., detecting a red light) to form the predicates. Additionally, we construct a Multimodal RAG model that leverages video data, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn more effectively from past similar driving experiences. By integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets. This advancement enables more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving systems that learn from experience, obey traffic laws, and perform precise control actions.</p></details> |  |

Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Through a systematic evaluation of leading models, we find that while these systems show promising capabilities in basic perception tasks - achieving near-perfect performance in equipment identification and standardized data extraction - they exhibit fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning, cross-modal information synthesis, and multi-step logical inference. Our insights have important implications beyond chemistry and materials science, suggesting that developing reliable multimodal AI scientific assistants may require advances in curating suitable training data and approaches to training those models.</p></details> |  |
| **[PaliGemma-CXR: A Multi-task Multimodal Model for TB Chest X-ray Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00171v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a infectious global health challenge. Chest X-rays are a standard method for TB screening, yet many countries face a critical shortage of radiologists capable of interpreting these images. Machine learning offers an alternative, as it can automate tasks such as disease diagnosis, and report generation. However, traditional approaches rely on task-specific models, which cannot utilize the interdependence between tasks. Building a multi-task model capable of performing multiple tasks poses additional challenges such as scarcity of multimodal data, dataset imbalance, and negative transfer. To address these challenges, we propose PaliGemma-CXR, a multi-task multimodal model capable of performing TB diagnosis, object detection, segmentation, report generation, and VQA. Starting with a dataset of chest X-ray images annotated with TB diagnosis labels and segmentation masks, we curated a multimodal dataset to support additional tasks. By finetuning PaliGemma on this dataset and sampling data using ratios of the inverse of the size of task datasets, we achieved the following results across all tasks: 90.32% accuracy on TB diagnosis and 98.95% on close-ended VQA, 41.3 BLEU score on report generation, and a mAP of 19.4 and 16.0 on object detection and segmentation, respectively. These results demonstrate that PaliGemma-CXR effectively leverages the interdependence between multiple image interpretation tasks to enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Toward Foundational Model for Sleep Analysis Using a Multimodal Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17481v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Multimodal Search on a Line](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07000v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the diverse set of technologies used in underground object detection and imaging, we introduce a novel multimodal linear search problem whereby a single searcher starts at the origin and must find a target that can only be detected when the searcher moves through its location using the correct of $p$ possible search modes. The target's location, its distance $d$ from the origin, and the correct search mode are all initially unknown to the searcher. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio for this problem. Specifically, we show that when $p$ is odd, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p+1)}$, whereas when $p$ is even, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $c$: the unique solution to $(c-1)^4-4p(c+1)^2(c-p-1)=0$ in the interval $\left[2p+1+\sqrt{8p},\infty\right)$. This solution $c$ has the explicit bounds $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p-1)}\leq c\leq 2p+3+\sqrt{8p}$. The optimal algorithms we propose require the searcher to move infinitesimal distances and change directions infinitely many times within finite intervals. To better suit practical applications, we also propose an approximation algorithm with a competitive ratio of $c+\varepsilon$ (where $c$ is the optimal competitive ratio and $\varepsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant). This algorithm involves the searcher moving finite distances and changing directions a finite number of times within any finite interval.</p></details> |  |

Slice sampling can resolve local exploration inefficiency issues and Riemannian geometries help with sharp curvatures. Recent extensions enable slice sampling on Riemannian manifolds, but they are restricted to cases where geodesics are available in closed form. We propose a method that generalizes Hit-and-Run slice sampling to more general geometries tailored to the target distribution, by approximating geodesics as solutions to differential equations. Our approach enables exploration of regions with strong curvature and rapid transitions between modes in multimodal distributions. We demonstrate the advantages of the approach over challenging sampling problems.</p></details> |  |

In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in a conference</p></details> |

Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant increase in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes is notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings, which are not directly conveyed through the overt text and image. In light of this, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest due to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In response to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity of various LMMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of social abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme benchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes such as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing GOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness, misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive experiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a deficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of implicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment to the realization of safe artificial intelligence. The GOAT-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://goatlmm.github.io/, contributing to ongoing research in this vital field.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first work to benchmark Large Multimodal Models in safety insight on social media</p></details> |

Traditional GNSS-based localization methods suffer from signal occlusion and multipath effects in urban environments. Meanwhile, methods relying on high-definition (HD) maps are constrained by the high costs associated with the construction and maintenance of HD maps. Standard-definition (SD) maps-based methods, on the other hand, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SegLocNet, a multimodal GNSS-free localization network that achieves precise localization using bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. SegLocNet employs a BEV segmentation network to generate semantic maps from multiple sensor inputs, followed by an exhaustive matching process to estimate the vehicle's ego pose. This approach avoids the limitations of regression-based pose estimation and maintains high interpretability and generalization. By introducing a unified map representation, our method can be applied to both HD and SD maps without any modifications to the network architecture, thereby balancing localization accuracy and area coverage. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and that our method can accurately estimate the ego pose in urban environments without relying on GNSS, while maintaining strong generalization ability. Our code and pre-trained model will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiCEval: Unveiling Multimodal Chain of Thought's Quality via Image Description and Reasoning Steps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14668v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) is a popular prompting strategy for improving the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Despite its popularity, there is a notable absence of automated methods for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps in MCoT. To address this gap, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Evaluation (MiCEval), a framework designed to assess the correctness of reasoning chains by evaluating the quality of both the description and each reasoning step. The evaluation of the description component focuses on the accuracy of the image descriptions, while the reasoning step evaluates the quality of each step as it is conditionally generated based on the preceding steps. MiCEval is built upon a fine-grained dataset with annotations that rate each step according to correctness, relevance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art MLLMs show that step-wise evaluations using MiCEval align more closely with human judgments compared to existing methods based on cosine similarity or fine-tuning approaches. MiCEval datasets and code can be found in https://github.com/alenai97/MiCEval.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

Most existing methods transfer visual/linguistic knowledge separately by fully fine-tuning uni-modal pre-trained models, followed by a simple stack of visual-language transformers for multimodal fusion. However, these approaches not only limit adequate interaction between visual and linguistic contexts, but also incur significant computational costs. Therefore, to address these issues, we explore a step-wise multimodal fusion and adaption framework, namely SwimVG. Specifically, SwimVG proposes step-wise multimodal prompts (Swip) and cross-modal interactive adapters (CIA) for visual grounding, replacing the cumbersome transformer stacks for multimodal fusion. Swip can improve {the} alignment between the vision and language representations step by step, in a token-level fusion manner. In addition, weight-level CIA further promotes multimodal fusion by cross-modal interaction. Swip and CIA are both parameter-efficient paradigms, and they fuse the cross-modal features from shallow to deep layers gradually. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that SwimVG achieves remarkable abilities and considerable benefits in terms of efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/liuting20/SwimVG.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Modality Contribution in Multimodal Medical Deep Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01904v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose High dimensional, multimodal data can nowadays be analyzed by huge deep neural networks with little effort. Several fusion methods for bringing together different modalities have been developed. Particularly, in the field of medicine with its presence of high dimensional multimodal patient data, multimodal models characterize the next step. However, what is yet very underexplored is how these models process the source information in detail. Methods To this end, we implemented an occlusion-based both model and performance agnostic modality contribution method that quantitatively measures the importance of each modality in the dataset for the model to fulfill its task. We applied our method to three different multimodal medical problems for experimental purposes. Results Herein we found that some networks have modality preferences that tend to unimodal collapses, while some datasets are imbalanced from the ground up. Moreover, we could determine a link between our metric and the performance of single modality trained nets. Conclusion The information gain through our metric holds remarkable potential to improve the development of multimodal models and the creation of datasets in the future. With our method we make a crucial contribution to the field of interpretability in deep learning based multimodal research and thereby notably push the integrability of multimodal AI into clinical practice.

To address this challenge, this work uses generative large language models (LLMs) and multilingual CLIP models to enhance idiomatic compound representations. LLMs generate idiomatic meanings for potentially idiomatic compounds, enriching their semantic interpretation. These meanings are then encoded using multilingual CLIP models, serving as representations for image ranking. Contrastive learning and data augmentation techniques are applied to fine-tune these embeddings for improved performance. Experimental results show that multimodal representations extracted through this method outperformed those based solely on the original nominal compounds. The fine-tuning approach shows promising outcomes but is less effective than using embeddings without fine-tuning. The source code used in this paper is available at https://github.com/tongwu17/SemEval-2025-Task1-UoR-NCL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Learning for Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction in Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20806v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rise of autonomous driving technologies has highlighted the critical importance of reliable software for ensuring safety and performance. This paper proposes a novel approach for just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) in autonomous driving software systems using multimodal learning. The proposed model leverages the multimodal transformers in which the pre-trained transformers and a combining module deal with the multiple data modalities of the software system datasets such as code features, change metrics, and contextual information. The key point for adapting multimodal learning is to utilize the attention mechanism between the different data modalities such as text, numerical, and categorical. In the combining module, the output of a transformer model on text data and tabular features containing categorical and numerical data are combined to produce the predictions using the fully connected layers. Experiments conducted on three open-source autonomous driving system software projects collected from the GitHub repository (Apollo, Carla, and Donkeycar) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models regarding evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning to enhance the reliability and safety of autonomous driving software through improved defect prediction.</p></details> | 9 |

Consequently, LLMs have made significant strides in processing and integrating multimodal information. However, even though human personas can be expressed in both text and image, the extent to which the modality of a persona impacts the embodiment by the LLM remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how do different modalities influence the expressiveness of personas in multimodal LLMs. To this end, we create a novel modality-parallel dataset of 40 diverse personas varying in age, gender, occupation, and location. This consists of four modalities to equivalently represent a persona: image-only, text-only, a combination of image and small text, and typographical images, where text is visually stylized to convey persona-related attributes. We then create a systematic evaluation framework with 60 questions and corresponding metrics to assess how well LLMs embody each persona across its attributes and scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on $5$ multimodal LLMs show that personas represented by detailed text show more linguistic habits, while typographical images often show more consistency with the persona. Our results reveal that LLMs often overlook persona-specific details conveyed through images, highlighting underlying limitations and paving the way for future research to bridge this gap. We release the data and code at https://github.com/claws-lab/persona-modality .</p></details> |  |

However, how representational co-speech gestures refer to objects remains understudied from a computational perspective. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal reference resolution task centred on representational gestures, while simultaneously tackling the challenge of learning robust gesture embeddings. We propose a self-supervised pre-training approach to gesture representation learning that grounds body movements in spoken language. Our experiments show that the learned embeddings align with expert annotations and have significant predictive power. Moreover, reference resolution accuracy further improves when (1) using multimodal gesture representations, even when speech is unavailable at inference time, and (2) leveraging dialogue history. Overall, our findings highlight the complementary roles of gesture and speech in reference resolution, offering a step towards more naturalistic models of human-machine interaction.</p></details> |  |

We present MMSciBench, a benchmark for evaluating mathematical and physical reasoning through text-only and text-image formats, with human-annotated difficulty levels, solutions with detailed explanations, and taxonomic mappings. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant limitations, with even the best model achieving only \textbf{63.77\%} accuracy and particularly struggling with visual reasoning tasks.

However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises $2,138$ question triplets, totaling $6,414$ distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by $31.73\%$, compared to an average gap of $8.03\%$ in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by $23.09\%$, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just $14.64\%$).

Although there have been efforts to control output images with additional conditions, like canny and depth map, a comprehensive framework for arbitrary text-image interleaved control is still lacking. This gap is especially evident when attempting to merge concepts or visual elements from multiple images in the generation process. To mitigate the gap, we conducted preliminary experiments showing that large multimodal models (LMMs) offer an effective shared representation space, where image and text can be well-aligned to serve as a condition for external diffusion models. Based on this discovery, we propose Dream Engine, an efficient and unified framework designed for arbitrary text-image interleaved control in image generation models. Building on powerful text-to-image models like SD3.5, we replace the original text-only encoders by incorporating versatile multimodal information encoders such as QwenVL. Our approach utilizes a two-stage training paradigm, consisting of joint text-image alignment and multimodal interleaved instruction tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that this training method is effective, achieving a 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark, and matching the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like SD3.5 and FLUX.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, codebase in https://github.com/chenllliang/DreamEngine</p></details> |

Despite its potential to advance diverse research fields like social networks and e-commerce, MAG representation learning (MAGRL) remains underexplored due to the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation frameworks. In this paper, we first propose MAGB, a comprehensive MAG benchmark dataset, featuring curated graphs from various domains with both textual and visual attributes. Based on MAGB dataset, we further systematically evaluate two mainstream MAGRL paradigms: $\textit{GNN-as-Predictor}$, which integrates multimodal attributes via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and $\textit{VLM-as-Predictor}$, which harnesses Vision Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot reasoning. Extensive experiments on MAGB reveal following critical insights: $\textit{(i)}$ Modality significances fluctuate drastically with specific domain characteristics. $\textit{(ii)}$ Multimodal embeddings can elevate the performance ceiling of GNNs. However, intrinsic biases among modalities may impede effective training, particularly in low-data scenarios. $\textit{(iii)}$ VLMs are highly effective at generating multimodal embeddings that alleviate the imbalance between textual and visual attributes. These discoveries, which illuminate the synergy between multimodal attributes and graph topologies, contribute to reliable benchmarks, paving the way for future MAG research. The MAGB dataset and evaluation pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/sktsherlock/MAGB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Multimodal Learning from the Perspective of Mitigating Classification Ability Disproportion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20120v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multimodal learning~(MML) has garnered remarkable progress, the existence of modality imbalance hinders multimodal learning from achieving its expected superiority over unimodal models in practice. To overcome this issue, mainstream multimodal learning methods have placed greater emphasis on balancing the learning process. However, these approaches do not explicitly enhance the classification ability of weaker modalities, leading to limited performance promotion. By designing a sustained boosting algorithm, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors using a designed configurable classifier module. Then, we propose an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of weak modality. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on widely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison with various state-of-the-art~(SoTA) multimodal learning baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, their capability in more challenging and real-world related scenarios like engineering has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we propose EEE-Bench, a multimodal benchmark aimed at assessing LMMs' capabilities in solving practical engineering tasks, using electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) as the testbed. Our benchmark consists of 2860 carefully curated problems spanning 10 essential subdomains such as analog circuits, control systems, etc. Compared to benchmarks in other domains, engineering problems are intrinsically 1) more visually complex and versatile and 2) less deterministic in solutions. Successful solutions to these problems often demand more-than-usual rigorous integration of visual and textual information as models need to understand intricate images like abstract circuits and system diagrams while taking professional instructions, making them excellent candidates for LMM evaluations. Alongside EEE-Bench, we provide extensive quantitative evaluations and fine-grained analysis of 17 widely-used open and closed-sourced LLMs and LMMs. Our results demonstrate notable deficiencies of current foundation models in EEE, with an average performance ranging from 19.48% to 46.78%. Finally, we reveal and explore a critical shortcoming in LMMs which we term laziness: the tendency to take shortcuts by relying on the text while overlooking the visual context when reasoning for technical image problems. In summary, we believe EEE-Bench not only reveals some noteworthy limitations of LMMs but also provides a valuable resource for advancing research on their application in practical engineering tasks, driving future improvements in their capability to handle complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

GOAP contains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships between observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts with the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into fixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with open-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)} dataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about 30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along with the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train Minecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2 exhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and open-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.</p></details> | Accept to CVPR 2025 |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

We introduce Chitranuvad, a multimodal model that effectively integrates Multilingual LLM and a vision module for Multimodal Translation. Our method uses a ViT image encoder to extract visual representations as visual token embeddings which are projected to the LLM space by an adapter layer and generates translation in an autoregressive fashion. We participated in all the three tracks (Image Captioning, Text only and Multimodal translation tasks) for Indic languages (ie. English translation to Hindi, Bengali and Malyalam) and achieved SOTA results for Hindi in all of them on the Challenge set while remaining competitive for the other languages in the shared task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Completed Feature Disentanglement Learning for Multimodal MRIs Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04916v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal MRIs play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Feature disentanglement (FD)-based methods, aiming at learning superior feature representations for multimodal data analysis, have achieved significant success in multimodal learning (MML). Typically, existing FD-based methods separate multimodal data into modality-shared and modality-specific features, and employ concatenation or attention mechanisms to integrate these features. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that these methods could lead to a loss of shared information among subsets of modalities when the inputs contain more than two modalities, and such information is critical for prediction accuracy. Furthermore, these methods do not adequately interpret the relationships between the decoupled features at the fusion stage. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Complete Feature Disentanglement (CFD) strategy that recovers the lost information during feature decoupling. Specifically, the CFD strategy not only identifies modality-shared and modality-specific features, but also decouples shared features among subsets of multimodal inputs, termed as modality-partial-shared features. We further introduce a new Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts Fusion (DMF) module that dynamically integrates these decoupled features, by explicitly learning the local-global relationships among the features. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through classification tasks on three multimodal MRI datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art MML methods with obvious margins, showcasing its superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by IEEE JBHI 2025</p></details> |

| **[Talking like Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18928v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a methodology that allows communication with Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) using natural language. In particular, we represent P&IDs through the DEXPI data model as labeled property graphs and integrate them with Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach consists of three main parts: 1) P&IDs are cast into a graph representation from the DEXPI format using our pyDEXPI Python package. 2) A tool for generating P&ID knowledge graphs from pyDEXPI. 3) Integration of the P&ID knowledge graph to LLMs using graph-based retrieval augmented generation (graph-RAG). This approach allows users to communicate with P&IDs using natural language. It extends LLM's ability to retrieve contextual data from P&IDs and mitigate hallucinations. Leveraging the LLM's large corpus, the model is also able to interpret process information in PIDs, which could help engineers in their daily tasks. In the future, this work will also open up opportunities in the context of other generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) solutions on P&IDs, and AI-assisted HAZOP studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16130v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as "What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, do not scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages: first, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Knowledge Graphs Enhance Medical Question Answering: Bridging the Gap Between LLMs and Evolving Medical Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13010v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced medical question-answering by leveraging extensive clinical data and medical literature. However, the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and the labor-intensive process of manually updating domain-specific resources pose challenges to the reliability of these systems. To address this, we introduce Adaptive Medical Graph-RAG (AMG-RAG), a comprehensive framework that automates the construction and continuous updating of medical knowledge graphs, integrates reasoning, and retrieves current external evidence, such as PubMed and WikiSearch. By dynamically linking new findings and complex medical concepts, AMG-RAG not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability in medical queries. Evaluations on the MEDQA and MEDMCQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG-RAG, achieving an F1 score of 74.1 percent on MEDQA and an accuracy of 66.34 percent on MEDMCQA, outperforming both comparable models and those 10 to 100 times larger. Notably, these improvements are achieved without increasing computational overhead, highlighting the critical role of automated knowledge graph generation and external evidence retrieval in delivering up-to-date, trustworthy medical insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[EACO-RAG: Towards Distributed Tiered LLM Deployment using Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG with Adaptive Knowledge Update](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20299v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language tasks, but they require high computing power and rely on static knowledge. To overcome these limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates up-to-date external information into LLMs without extensive fine-tuning. Meanwhile, small language models (SLMs) deployed on edge devices offer efficiency and low latency but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Unfortunately, current RAG approaches are predominantly based on centralized databases and have not been adapted to address the distinct constraints associated with deploying SLMs in edge environments. To bridge this gap, we propose Edge-Assisted and Collaborative RAG (EACO-RAG), a lightweight framework that leverages distributed edge nodes for adaptive knowledge updates and retrieval. EACO-RAG also employs a hierarchical collaborative gating mechanism to dynamically select among local, edge-assisted, and cloud-based strategies, with a carefully designed algorithm based on Safe Online Bayesian Optimization to maximize the potential performance enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that EACO-RAG matches the accuracy of cloud-based knowledge graph RAG systems while reducing total costs by up to 84.6% under relaxed delay constraints and by 65.3% under stricter delay requirements. This work represents our initial effort toward achieving a distributed and scalable tiered LLM deployments, with EACO-RAG serving as a promising first step in unlocking the full potential of hybrid edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[KET-RAG: A Cost-Efficient Multi-Granular Indexing Framework for Graph-RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09304v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-RAG constructs a knowledge graph from text chunks to improve retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is particularly useful in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political science, where retrieval often requires multi-hop reasoning over proprietary documents. Some existing Graph-RAG systems construct KNN graphs based on text chunk relevance, but this coarse-grained approach fails to capture entity relationships within texts, leading to sub-par retrieval and generation quality. To address this, recent solutions leverage LLMs to extract entities and relationships from text chunks, constructing triplet-based knowledge graphs. However, this approach incurs significant indexing costs, especially for large document collections. To ensure a good result accuracy while reducing the indexing cost, we propose KET-RAG, a multi-granular indexing framework. KET-RAG first identifies a small set of key text chunks and leverages an LLM to construct a knowledge graph skeleton. It then builds a text-keyword bipartite graph from all text chunks, serving as a lightweight alternative to a full knowledge graph. During retrieval, KET-RAG searches both structures: it follows the local search strategy of existing Graph-RAG systems on the skeleton while mimicking this search on the bipartite graph to improve retrieval quality. We evaluate eight solutions on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that KET-RAG outperforms all competitors in indexing cost, retrieval effectiveness, and generation quality. Notably, it achieves comparable or superior retrieval quality to Microsoft's Graph-RAG while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude. Additionally, it improves the generation quality by up to 32.4% while lowering indexing costs by around 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph RAG-Tool Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07223v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for selecting relevant tools from a tool knowledge base enable LLM agents to scale their complex tool calling capabilities to hundreds or thousands of external tools, APIs, or agents-as-tools. However, traditional RAG-based tool retrieval fails to capture structured dependencies between tools, limiting the retrieval accuracy of a retrieved tool's dependencies. For example, among a vector database of tools, a "get stock price" API requires a "stock ticker" parameter from a "get stock ticker" API, and both depend on OS-level internet connectivity tools. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing Graph RAG-Tool Fusion, a novel plug-and-play approach that combines the strengths of vector-based retrieval with efficient graph traversal to capture all relevant tools (nodes) along with any nested dependencies (edges) within the predefined tool knowledge graph. We also present ToolLinkOS, a new tool selection benchmark of 573 fictional tools, spanning over 15 industries, each with an average of 6.3 tool dependencies. We demonstrate that Graph RAG-Tool Fusion achieves absolute improvements of 71.7% and 22.1% over na\"ive RAG on ToolLinkOS and ToolSandbox benchmarks, respectively (mAP@10). ToolLinkOS dataset is available at https://github.com/EliasLumer/Graph-RAG-Tool-Fusion-ToolLinkOS</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We discuss benchmarks, evaluation methods, and evaluation metrics. Also, we uniquely study the use of Graph RAGs for better contextual accuracy and schema linking in these systems.

| **[Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaGRAG | Exploring the Topology of Information for Advancing Language Understanding and Generation in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18644v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to enhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge. However, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information present in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a novel GRAG framework, Dynamic Graph Retrieval-Agumented Generation (DynaGRAG), is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs and information within them, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaGRAG, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graphs Meet Thoughts: Enhancing Complex Reasoning in Graph-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14892v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine and law, it is critical not only to retrieve relevant information but also to provide causal reasoning and explainability. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We initiated an AI agent designed to provide customers with relevant information about banking services and insights from annual reports. We proposed a hybrid Customer Analysis Pipeline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CAPRAG) that effectively addresses both relationship-based and contextual queries, thereby improving customer engagement in the digital banking landscape. To implement this, we developed a processing pipeline to refine text data, which we utilized in two main frameworks: Vector RAG and Graph RAG. This dual approach enables us to populate both vector and graph databases with processed data for efficient retrieval. The Cypher query component is employed to effectively query the graph database. When a user submits a query, it is first expanded by a query expansion module before being routed to construct a final query from the hybrid Knowledge Base (KB). This final query is then sent to an open-source LLM for response generation. Overall, our innovative, designed to international banks, serves bank's customers in an increasingly complex digital environment, enhancing clarity and accessibility of information.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Superpixel-Based Building Damage Detection from Post-earthquake Imagery Using Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04744v5)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building damage detection after natural disasters like earthquakes is crucial for initiating effective emergency response actions. Remotely sensed very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery can provide vital information due to their ability to map the affected buildings with high geometric precision. However, we suffer from suboptimal performances in detecting damaged buildings due to earthquakes. This paper presents a novel superpixel based approach incorporates Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with a modified segmentation method, for more precise building damage detection from VHR imagery. Firstly, a modified Fast Scanning and Adaptive Merging method is extended to create initial over-segmentation. Secondly, the segments are properly merged based on the Region Adjacent Graph (RAG). Thirdly, a pre-trained DNN using Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders (SDAE-DNN) is presented, to exploit the rich semantic features for building damage detection. Experimental results on a WorldView-2 imagery from Nepal Earthquake of 2015 demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, which could boost detection accuracy through learning more intrinsic and discriminative features, which outperforms other methods using alternative classifiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Graphs (GraphRAG)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00309v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances downstream task execution by retrieving additional information, such as knowledge, skills, and tools from external sources. Graph, by its intrinsic "nodes connected by edges" nature, encodes massive heterogeneous and relational information, making it a golden resource for RAG in tremendous real-world applications. As a result, we have recently witnessed increasing attention on equipping RAG with Graph, i.e., GraphRAG. However, unlike conventional RAG, where the retriever, generator, and external data sources can be uniformly designed in the neural-embedding space, the uniqueness of graph-structured data, such as diverse-formatted and domain-specific relational knowledge, poses unique and significant challenges when designing GraphRAG for different domains. Given the broad applicability, the associated design challenges, and the recent surge in GraphRAG, a systematic and up-to-date survey of its key concepts and techniques is urgently desired. Following this motivation, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on GraphRAG. Our survey first proposes a holistic GraphRAG framework by defining its key components, including query processor, retriever, organizer, generator, and data source. Furthermore, recognizing that graphs in different domains exhibit distinct relational patterns and require dedicated designs, we review GraphRAG techniques uniquely tailored to each domain. Finally, we discuss research challenges and brainstorm directions to inspire cross-disciplinary opportunities. Our survey repository is publicly maintained at https://github.com/Graph-RAG/GraphRAG/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Developing an Artificial Intelligence Tool for Personalized Breast Cancer Treatment Plans based on the NCCN Guidelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15698v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer treatments require personalized approaches based on a patient's clinical condition, medical history, and evidence-based guidelines. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides frequently updated, complex guidelines through visuals like flowcharts and diagrams, which can be time consuming for oncologists to stay current with treatment protocols. This study presents an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven methodology to accurately automate treatment regimens following NCCN guidelines for breast cancer patients. We proposed two AI-driven methods: Agentic-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Graph-RAG. Agentic-RAG used a three-step Large Language Model (LLM) process to select clinical titles from NCCN guidelines, retrieve matching JSON content, and iteratively refine recommendations based on insufficiency checks. Graph-RAG followed a Microsoft-developed framework with proprietary prompts, where JSON data was converted to text via an LLM, summarized, and mapped into graph structures representing key treatment relationships. Final recommendations were generated by querying relevant graph summaries. Both were evaluated using a set of patient descriptions, each with four associated questions. As shown in Table 1, Agentic RAG achieved a 100% adherence (24/24) with no hallucinations or incorrect treatments. Graph-RAG had 95.8% adherence (23/24) with one incorrect treatment and no hallucinations. Chat GPT-4 showed 91.6% adherence (22/24) with two wrong treatments and no hallucinations. Both Agentic RAG and Graph-RAG provided detailed treatment recommendations with accurate references to relevant NCCN document page numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[HybGRAG: Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16311v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a semi-structured knowledge base (SKB), where text documents are interconnected by relations, how can we effectively retrieve relevant information to answer user questions? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves documents to assist large language models (LLMs) in question answering; while Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowledge bases as its knowledge source. However, many questions require both textual and relational information from SKB - referred to as "hybrid" questions - which complicates the retrieval process and underscores the need for a hybrid retrieval method that leverages both information. In this paper, through our empirical analysis, we identify key insights that show why existing methods may struggle with hybrid question answering (HQA) over SKB. Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages: (1) Agentic, it automatically refines the output by incorporating feedback from the critic module, (2) Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank, (3) Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and (4) Effective, it surpasses all baselines on HQA benchmarks. In experiments on the STaRK benchmark, HybGRAG achieves significant performance gains, with an average relative improvement in Hit@1 of 51%.</p></details> |  |

In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results. While this method demonstrates significant improvements in performance, it comes with challenges. It is both costly and more complex to implement across diverse contexts, requiring careful adaptation to specific scenarios. Additionally, its effectiveness heavily relies on having complete and accurate input data, which may not always be readily available, posing further limitations to its scalability and practicality.</p></details> |  |

However, the generation of precise and regulation-compliant diagrams remains a significant challenge, particularly in scaling breakthroughs from material discovery to industrial production in an era of automation and digitalization. This paper introduces an autonomous agentic framework to address these challenges through a twostage approach involving knowledge acquisition and generation. The framework integrates specialized sub-agents for retrieving and synthesizing multimodal data from publicly available online sources and constructs ontological knowledge graphs using a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) paradigm. These capabilities enable the automation of diagram generation and open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks with high contextual accuracy. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the frameworks ability to deliver regulation-compliant diagrams with minimal expert intervention, highlighting its practical utility for industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[G-RAG: Knowledge Expansion in Material Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14592v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Material Science, effective information retrieval systems are essential for facilitating research. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches in Large Language Models (LLMs) often encounter challenges such as outdated information, hallucinations, limited interpretability due to context constraints, and inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, Graph RAG integrates graph databases to enhance the retrieval process. Our proposed method processes Material Science documents by extracting key entities (referred to as MatIDs) from sentences, which are then utilized to query external Wikipedia knowledge bases (KBs) for additional relevant information. We implement an agent-based parsing technique to achieve a more detailed representation of the documents. Our improved version of Graph RAG called G-RAG further leverages a graph database to capture relationships between these entities, improving both retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. This enhanced approach demonstrates significant improvements in performance for domains that require precise information retrieval, such as Material Science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Management for Automobile Failure Analysis Using Graph RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19539v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a knowledge management system for automobile failure analysis using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs). In the automotive industry, there is a growing demand for knowledge transfer of failure analysis from experienced engineers to young engineers. However, failure events are phenomena that occur in a chain reaction, making them difficult for beginners to analyze them. While knowledge graphs, which can describe semantic relationships and structure information is effective in representing failure events, due to their capability of representing the relationships between components, there is much information in KGs, so it is challenging for young engineers to extract and understand sub-graphs from the KG. On the other hand, there is increasing interest in the use of Graph RAG, a type of RAG that combines LLMs and KGs for knowledge management. However, when using the current Graph RAG framework with an existing knowledge graph for automobile failures, several issues arise because it is difficult to generate executable queries for a knowledge graph database which is not constructed by LLMs. To address this, we focused on optimizing the Graph RAG pipeline for existing knowledge graphs. Using an original Q&A dataset, the ROUGE F1 score of the sentences generated by the proposed method showed an average improvement of 157.6% compared to the current method. This highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for automobile failure analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Bid Data (BigData)</p></details> |
| **[AMSnet-KG: A Netlist Dataset for LLM-based AMS Circuit Auto-Design Using Knowledge Graph RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13560v1)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits are mainly full-custom designed, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A significant portion of the effort is experience-driven, which makes the automation of AMS circuit design a formidable challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) applications, fostering advancements in the automatic design process for large-scale AMS circuits. However, the absence of high-quality datasets has led to issues such as model hallucination, which undermines the robustness of automatically generated circuit designs. To address this issue, this paper introduces AMSnet-KG, a dataset encompassing various AMS circuit schematics and netlists. We construct a knowledge graph with annotations on detailed functional and performance characteristics. Facilitated by AMSnet-KG, we propose an automated AMS circuit generation framework that utilizes the comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs. We first formulate a design strategy (e.g., circuit architecture using a number of circuit components) based on required specifications. Next, matched circuit components are retrieved and assembled into a complete topology, and transistor sizing is obtained through Bayesian optimization. Simulation results of the netlist are fed back to the LLM for further topology refinement, ensuring the circuit design specifications are met. We perform case studies of operational amplifier and comparator design to verify the automatic design flow from specifications to netlists with minimal human effort. The dataset used in this paper will be open-sourced upon publishing of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Perspective on ADHD Research: Knowledge Graph Construction with LLMs and Network Based Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12853v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a challenging disorder to study due to its complex symptomatology and diverse contributing factors. To explore how we can gain deeper insights on this topic, we performed a network analysis on a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) of ADHD, constructed by integrating scientific literature and clinical data with the help of cutting-edge large language models. The analysis, including k-core techniques, identified critical nodes and relationships that are central to understanding the disorder. Building on these findings, we curated a knowledge graph that is usable in a context-aware chatbot (Graph-RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling accurate and informed interactions. Our knowledge graph not only advances the understanding of ADHD but also provides a powerful tool for research and clinical applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Medical Graph RAG: Towards Safe Medical Large Language Model via Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04187v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for the medical domain, called \textbf{MedGraphRAG}, aimed at enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for generating evidence-based medical responses, thereby improving safety and reliability when handling private medical data. Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages LLMs to organize RAG data into graphs, showing strong potential for gaining holistic insights from long-form documents. However, its standard implementation is overly complex for general use and lacks the ability to generate evidence-based responses, limiting its effectiveness in the medical field. To extend the capabilities of GraphRAG to the medical domain, we propose unique Triple Graph Construction and U-Retrieval techniques over it. In our graph construction, we create a triple-linked structure that connects user documents to credible medical sources and controlled vocabularies. In the retrieval process, we propose U-Retrieval which combines Top-down Precise Retrieval with Bottom-up Response Refinement to balance global context awareness with precise indexing. These effort enable both source information retrieval and comprehensive response generation. Our approach is validated on 9 medical Q\&A benchmarks, 2 health fact-checking benchmarks, and one collected dataset testing long-form generation. The results show that MedGraphRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across all benchmarks, while also ensuring that responses include credible source documentation and definitions. Our code is released at: https://github.com/MedicineToken/Medical-Graph-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepMerge: Deep-Learning-Based Region-Merging for Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19787v2)** | 2024-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation aims to partition an image according to the objects in the scene and is a fundamental step in analysing very high spatial-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery. Current methods struggle to effectively consider land objects with diverse shapes and sizes. Additionally, the determination of segmentation scale parameters frequently adheres to a static and empirical doctrine, posing limitations on the segmentation of large-scale remote sensing images and yielding algorithms with limited interpretability. To address the above challenges, we propose a deep-learning-based region merging method dubbed DeepMerge to handle the segmentation of complete objects in large VHR images by integrating deep learning and region adjacency graph (RAG). This is the first method to use deep learning to learn the similarity and merge similar adjacent super-pixels in RAG. We propose a modified binary tree sampling method to generate shift-scale data, serving as inputs for transformer-based deep learning networks, a shift-scale attention with 3-Dimension relative position embedding to learn features across scales, and an embedding to fuse learned features with hand-crafted features. DeepMerge can achieve high segmentation accuracy in a supervised manner from large-scale remotely sensed images and provides an interpretable optimal scale parameter, which is validated using a remote sensing image of 0.55 m resolution covering an area of 5,660 km^2. The experimental results show that DeepMerge achieves the highest F value (0.9550) and the lowest total error TE (0.0895), correctly segmenting objects of different sizes and outperforming all competing segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14322v1)** | 2023-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advances in deep neural networks, standard convolutional kernels limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention GAT. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). We then construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). We evaluate our proposed methods on two remote sensing datasets namely Asia14 and C2D2. In comparison with both non-graph and graph-based approaches our SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA achieved superior accuracy on all the datasets while incurring less computation cost. The code and dataset will be made public via our GitHub repository.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-class Brain Tumor Segmentation using Graph Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05598v1)** | 2023-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain tumor segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in diagnostic radiology. To overcome the practical issues in manual approaches, there is a huge demand for building automatic tumor segmentation algorithms. This work introduces an efficient brain tumor summation model by exploiting the advancement in MRI and graph neural networks (GNNs). The model represents the volumetric MRI as a region adjacency graph (RAG) and learns to identify the type of tumors through a graph attention network (GAT) -- a variant of GNNs. The ablation analysis conducted on two benchmark datasets proves that the proposed model can produce competitive results compared to the leading-edge solutions. It achieves mean dice scores of 0.91, 0.86, 0.79, and mean Hausdorff distances in the 95th percentile (HD95) of 5.91, 6.08, and 9.52 mm, respectively, for whole tumor, core tumor, and enhancing tumor segmentation on BraTS2021 validation dataset. On average, these performances are >6\% and >50%, compared to a GNN-based baseline model, respectively, on dice score and HD95 evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Superpixel Image Classification with Graph Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05544v2)** | 2020-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a methodology for image classification using Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. We transform the input images into region adjacency graphs (RAGs), in which regions are superpixels and edges connect neighboring superpixels. Our experiments suggest that Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which combine graph convolutions with self-attention mechanisms, outperforms other GNN models. Although raw image classifiers perform better than GATs due to information loss during the RAG generation, our methodology opens an interesting avenue of research on deep learning beyond rectangular-gridded images, such as 360-degree field of view panoramas. Traditional convolutional kernels of current state-of-the-art methods cannot handle panoramas, whereas the adapted superpixel algorithms and the resulting region adjacency graphs can naturally feed a GNN, without topology issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flooding edge or node weighted graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5756v1)** | 2013-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstruction closings have all properties of a physical flooding of a topographic surface. They are precious for simplifying gradient images or, filling unwanted catchment basins, on which a subsequent watershed transform extracts the targeted objects. Flooding a topographic surface may be modeled as flooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights representing the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be modeled on the region adjacency graph (RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG each node represents a catchment basin and edges connect neighboring nodes. The edges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent regions. The graph is flooded from sources placed at the marker positions and each node is assigned to the source by which it has been flooded. The level of the flood is represented on the nodes on each type of graphs. The same flooding may thus be modeled on a TG or on a RAG. We characterize all valid floodings on both types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then show that each flooding of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge weighted graph with appropriate edge weights. The highest flooding under a ceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the root for the ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric distance between two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both nodes are flooded. This remark permits to flood edge or node weighted graphs by using shortest path algorithms. It appears that the collection of all lakes of a RAG has the structure of a dendrogram, on which the highest flooding under a ceiling function may be rapidly found.</p></details> | <details><summary>165 p...</summary><p>165 pages, 21 figures</p></details> |
